          I have identified the above 6 key words as relevant for this webpage.
          The online shoe store will primarily sell shoes within Norway. The
          reasons for choosing these key words are first and foremost because
          the store sells sneakers and the relatively high search interest
          numbers for these key words according to Google Trends.

        <p>
          Above: Screenshot from search word "sko", which is a very generic term
          to include, yet very important to have included as key word since it
          does not lose popularity with shifting seasons. It has a high score
          throughout the year.

        <img class="google-trend" src="img/analyse-img/GoogleTrend2.png" />
        <p>
          Above: Screenshot from search word "Sneakers". Very specific term for
          my webpage, since it specialises in sneakers. However, it does lose
          popularity throughout the colder months of the year, understandably.

        <h3>SEO analysis of pages using lighthouse</h3>
        <p>
          The SEO analysis was performed via the Google Chrome Lighthouse
          extension. As specified in the task the page checks were done with
          only SEO checked. The results were not bad. Screenshots provided below
          with explanations.
        </p>
        <h4>Lighthouse check pre alterations, index.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/lighthouse_index_before.png" />
        <p>
          As we can see from the provided screenshot above, the index.html page
          receives a rating of 90 before any alterations to improve SEO have
          been made. The only remark made is that the page lacks a meta
          description
        </p>
        <h4>Lighthouse check pre alterations, product.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/lighthouse_product_before.png" />
        <p>
          Again a score of 90 pre alterations. Same result, lacking a meta
          description
        </p>
        <h4>Lighthouse check pre alterations, customerService.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/lighthouse_custserv_before.png" />
        <p>
          This time a score of 89, yet results are the same otherwise, lacking a
          meta description.

      <section id="UU">
        <h3>UU analysis of pages using WAVE</h3>
        <p>
          The accessibility check was performed using webaim.org (WAVE). Only
          the summary section for each page check will be provided due to
          extensive length on the detalied version.
        </p>
        <h4>WAVE check pre alterations, index.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/WAVE_index_before.png" />
        <p>
          WAVE identifes 4 errors and 1 alert on index.html. The 4 errors are
          divided into 2 empty links and 2 linked images missing alternative
          text. Regarding the empty links error: these errors are targeting the
          icons mangifying glass and the hamburger menu icon. In the index.html
          these are coded as links but are for the scope of oblig 3 (which is
          when they were developed) not intented to lead anywhere. Hence the
          empty link. These errors could easily have been avoided, but for
          simplicity that is the way it was developed. It was not, and is not,
          necessary to have them linked anywhere.
        </p>
        <h4>WAVE check pre alterations, product.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/WAVE_product_before.png" />
        <p>
          Again, as in index.html, it identifies errors regarding empty links.
          Again, this is for the sake of simplicity when developing oblig 3. I
          also get 3 errors regarding very low contrast on my banner where the
          breadcrumb trail is for displaying where you have navigated to. Last
          error for contrast is the text "popular brands". I also get 2 alerts.
          The first is for the fact that the 2 Hoka shoes have the same alt
          text. Second alert is for the underlined text in the LIMITED EDITION
          label on the Nike shoe. It should be removed as it indicates that the
          label is a link, which it technically is not in this case even though
          the image as a whole is clickable.
        </p>
        <h4>WAVE check pre alterations, customerService.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/WAVE_custserv_before.png" />
        <p>
          Same issues here as in both index and product page. Missing/empty
          links and contrast error raised for the low contrast text in the
          search field.

        <h4>Feedback on all three pages from chatGPT regarding SEO:</h4>
        <h5>Index.html</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Title "SnEEkZ" is present, which is good for SEO, but it could be
            more descriptive of the page content.
          </li>
          <li>
            No meta description tag is found which is important for SEO as it
            describes the page content in search results.
          </li>
          <li>
            Headings are used (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>), which is good for SEO structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Images have missing alt attributes, which are important for image
            search optimization.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>product.html</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The title tag "Document" is not descriptive and not helpful for SEO.
          </li>
          <li>
            No meta description tag is present, missing an opportunity for page
            summarization in search results.
          </li>
          <li>
            Breadcrumb navigation is good for SEO, providing a clear page
            hierarchy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is used appropriately, aiding in page
            structure understanding for search engines.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>customerService.html</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Title Tag: The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag currently says
            "Document", which is not descriptive and does not contain any
            keywords related to the business or content of the website. For SEO
            purposes, this should be a concise and accurate description of the
            page's content, ideally including relevant keywords.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meta Description: There is no meta description tag present in the
            head of the document. A meta description provides a summary of the
            page content that search engines can display in search results. It
            should include relevant keywords and a compelling description to
            encourage click-through.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heading Structure: The use of headings (<code>h1</code>,
            <code>h2</code>, etc.) seems to be semantically correct, but it's
            essential to ensure that they include relevant keywords for SEO.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alt Text for Images: Icons used in the document (such as those from
            FontAwesome) do not have alternative text which would describe the
            image or its function. Although these icons might be decorative, if
            they convey meaning or action (like the home icon or cart icon),
            they should have corresponding alt text.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content Quality: Since there is very little text content and it’s
            mostly template-like, it doesn’t offer much for search engines to
            index. Rich, keyword-optimized, relevant content is crucial for good
            SEO.
          </li>
          <li>
            Link Anchor Text: The links in the document are either icons or
            generic terms like "See More >". More descriptive link text could
            help SEO by providing search engines with more context about the
            linked content.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="GPTreviewUU">
        <h4>Feedback on all three pages from chatGPT regarding UU:</h4>
        <h5>index.html</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some images have empty alt attributes, which is not helpful for
            screen readers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The page uses aria-label appropriately in some links for assistive
            technologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Semantic HTML5 elements such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;,
            &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; are used properly,
            enhancing accessibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            The page does not contain a &lt;main&gt; landmark until halfway
            through the document, which could confuse navigation for screen
            reader users.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are potentially more than five &lt;div&gt; elements as
            specified in the comment, which may not meet the given instructions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>product.html</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Breadcrumb navigation has an aria-label, which is good for screen
            reader users.
          </li>
          <li>
            &lt;aside&gt; tag is used without an accessible name, making it
            unclear what the content represents for screen reader users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some interactive elements lack accessible names, like the filter
            button, which can be problematic for screen reader users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Text inside the &lt;p&gt; element within the &lt;div
            id="searchInput"&gt; is not explicitly associated with the search
            functionality.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>customerService.html</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Contrast Ratio: Without seeing the CSS, it’s impossible to evaluate
            the contrast ratio of the text to the background. High contrast is
            required for readability for users with visual impairments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accessible Navigation: It appears that there is a separate
            navigation section for mobile and desktop (id="mobileNavSection" and
            id="desktopNav"). It is important to ensure that both are fully
            keyboard navigable and that they work with screen readers without
            duplicative content that could confuse users.
          </li>
          <li>
            ARIA Labels: The use of ARIA attributes like aria-label on the
            analyze page link is good for conveying the purpose of the link to
            screen reader users. However, other icon links may also require ARIA
            labels if the icons have a function or convey a specific meaning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interactive Element Accessibility: Interactive elements such as
            links and buttons should be accessible with keyboard navigation and
            provide focus styles to assist users who are not using a mouse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Semantic HTML: Use of semantic HTML elements helps screen readers
            and assistive technologies understand the structure and content of
            the webpage. It's important to ensure that sections and other
            elements are used appropriately for their intended purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Skip Links: There are no skip links, which are helpful for
            keyboard-only users to bypass repetitive navigation links and
            quickly access main content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Language and Readability: Content should be clear and easily
            understandable. For example, abbreviations like "$" should be
            explained or supplemented with text for users who may not understand
            the symbol.
          </li>
          <li>
            Icon Font Fallback: There is a dependency on FontAwesome for icons.
            If the FontAwesome script fails to load or is blocked, users may not
            see the icons, potentially reducing the usability of the site. Text
            alternatives or fallbacks are necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Document Language: The document declares lang="en" which is good for
            accessibility, but ensure that any text not in English is
            appropriately marked with its language attribute.
