          I have identified the above 6 key words as relevant for this webpage.
          The online shoe store will primarily sell shoes within Norway. The
          reasons for choosing these key words are first and foremost because
          the store sells sneakers and the relatively high search interest
          numbers for these key words according to Google Trends.
        </p>
        <img class="google-trend" src="img/analyse-img/GoogleTrend1.png" />
        <p>
          Above: Screenshot from search word "sko", which is a very generic term
          to include, yet very important to have included as key word since it
          does not lose popularity with shifting seasons. It has a high score
          throughout the year.

        <img class="google-trend" src="img/analyse-img/GoogleTrend2.png" />
        <p>
          Above: Screenshot from search word "Sneakers". Very specific term for
          my webpage, since it specialises in sneakers. However, it does lose
          popularity throughout the colder months of the year, understandably.

      <section id="SEO">
        <h3>SEO analysis of pages using lighthouse</h3>
        <p>
          The SEO analysis was performed via the Google Chrome Lighthouse
          extension. As specified in the task the page checks were done with
          only SEO checked. The results were not bad. Screenshots provided below
          with explanations.
        </p>
        <h4>Lighthouse check pre alterations, index.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/lighthouse_index_before.png" />
        <p>
          As we can see from the provided screenshot above, the index.html page
          receives a rating of 90 before any alterations to improve SEO have
          been made. The only remark made is that the page lacks a meta
          description
        </p>
        <h4>Lighthouse check pre alterations, product.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/lighthouse_product_before.png" />
        <p>
          Again a score of 90 pre alterations. Same result, lacking a meta
          description
        </p>
        <h4>Lighthouse check pre alterations, customerService.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/lighthouse_custserv_before.png" />
        <p>
          This time a score of 89, yet results are the same otherwise, lacking a
          meta description.
        </p>

      <section id="UU">
        <h3>UU analysis of pages using WAVE</h3>
        <p>
          The accessibility check was performed using webaim.org (WAVE). Only
          the summary section for each page check will be provided due to
          extensive length on the detalied version.
        </p>
        <h4>WAVE check pre alterations, index.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/WAVE_index_before.png" />
        <p>
          WAVE identifes 4 errors and 1 alert on index.html. The 4 errors are
          divided into 2 empty links and 2 linked images missing alternative
          text. Regarding the empty links error: these errors are targeting the
          icons mangifying glass and the hamburger menu icon. In the index.html
          these are coded as links but are for the scope of oblig 3 (which is
          when they were developed) not intented to lead anywhere. Hence the
          empty link. These errors could easily have been avoided, but for
          simplicity that is the way it was developed. It was not, and is not,
          necessary to have them linked anywhere.
        </p>
        <h4>WAVE check pre alterations, product.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/WAVE_product_before.png" />
        <p>
          Again, as in index.html, it identifies errors regarding empty links.
          Again, this is for the sake of simplicity when developing oblig 3. I
          also get 3 errors regarding very low contrast on my banner where the
          breadcrumb trail is for displaying where you have navigated to. Last
          error for contrast is the text "popular brands". I also get 2 alerts.
          The first is for the fact that the 2 Hoka shoes have the same alt
          text. Second alert is for the underlined text in the LIMITED EDITION
          label on the Nike shoe. It should be removed as it indicates that the
          label is a link, which it technically is not in this case even though
          the image as a whole is clickable.
        </p>
        <h4>WAVE check pre alterations, customerService.html:</h4>
        <img src="img/analyse-img/WAVE_custserv_before.png" />
        <p>
          Same issues here as in both index and product page. Missing/empty
          links and contrast error raised for the low contrast text in the
          search field.
